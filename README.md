# Economic Policy Summarizer and Generator

A web application that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to summarize economic policy documents and **Generative AI** to create customized policies based on user scenarios.

---

## Features

1. **Document Summarization**:
   - Upload a PDF document containing economic policies.
   - The application extracts and summarizes the content using a pre-trained NLP model.

2. **Policy Generation**:
   - Input a scenario (e.g., "Reduce unemployment in a developing country").
   - The application generates a customized policy using Google's Generative AI (Gemini).

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple and intuitive web interface for uploading documents and inputting scenarios.
   - Displays summaries and generated policies in a clean and readable format.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for building the application.
- **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)**: Extracts text from uploaded PDF documents.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing (stopword removal, etc.).
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Uses the `distilbart-cnn-12-6` model for text summarization.
- **Google Generative AI**: Generates policies based on user scenarios.
- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables (e.g., API keys).
- **logging**: Logs errors and debug information.

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic content.

---

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload**:
   - Users upload a PDF document containing economic policies.
   - The backend extracts text from the PDF using PyMuPDF.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - The extracted text is cleaned by removing stopwords, punctuation, and extra spaces using NLTK and regular expressions.

3. **Summarization**:
   - The cleaned text is summarized using the Hugging Face `distilbart-cnn-12-6` model.

4. **Policy Generation**:
   - Users input a scenario (e.g., "Promote renewable energy adoption").
   - The backend uses Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to generate a customized policy based on the scenario.

5. **Display Results**:
   - The summary and generated policy are displayed on the web interface.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- A Google API key for Generative AI (Gemini).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/economic-policy-summarizer.git
   cd economic-policy-summarizer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Google API key:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF Document**:
   - Click on the "Upload" button and select a PDF file containing economic policies.
   - The application will extract and summarize the text.

2. **Generate a Policy**:
   - Enter a scenario in the input box (e.g., "Reduce income inequality").
   - Click "Generate Policy" to create a customized policy.
